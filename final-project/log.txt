Here’s what your pipeline has produced and what it means at each step:

---

## 1. Data cleaning & labeling

* **Duplicates removed:** 1 186 records dropped, leaving 213 764.
* **Age = 0 removed:** another 3 912 records dropped → 209 852 remain.
* **Survival label (“survived”=1 if “ทุเลา/หาย”):** 206 365 survivors vs. 3 487 non-survivors (≈98.3% survival).

**What this tells us**
The vast majority of injured patients survived, so all effect sizes will be small, and class imbalance is severe.

## 2. Q1: Top 5 factors for survivability (Random Forest importances)

1. Age (0.301)
2. Hour of accident (0.220)
3. Day of month (0.115)
4. Counterparty vehicle type (0.094)
5. Alcohol use (0.057)

**Interpretation**
Age is the strongest predictor, then time of day and date within the festival (early/late), followed by what the other vehicle was and whether the injured had been drinking.

---

## 3. Q2: Helmet effect in motorcycle accidents

* **ATE (DoWhy, PSM):** +0.0060
* **Naïve difference-in-means:** +0.0053

**Interpretation**
Wearing a helmet is estimated to increase survival probability by about 0.5–0.6 percentage points after covariate adjustment.

---

## 4. Q3: Seatbelt effect in car accidents

* **ATE:** +0.0102
* **Naïve difference:** +0.0082

**Interpretation**
Seatbelt use is estimated to increase survival by about 0.8–1.0 pp.

---

## 5. Q4: Alcohol’s effect on survival

* **ATE (PSM):** –0.0033

**Interpretation**
Drinking around the time of the crash appears to *decrease* survival by \~0.3 pp.

---

## 6. Q5: Hospital “effect” on survivability

* **Std dev of (observed – expected) survival rates across hospitals:** 0.053

**Interpretation**
Hospitals differ in survival rates by about ±5 pp around what you’d predict from age, sex, vehicle, road, etc.

|   0  |     0.9771    |

![Survival Rate by Hour of Day](attachment\:c2831c11-3250-4a0f-8ee6-e1986c52f30c.png)

**Interpretation**
Survival dips in the early-morning hours (4–5 AM) and peaks around midday (10–12 PM).

## Are these results “correct”?

Overall, the *patterns* you’ve uncovered are plausible and in line with what one might expect:

* **Age** and **time of day** really do dominate many trauma‐survival studies.
* Helmets and seatbelts show small but measurable boosts to survival probability.
* Alcohol worsens outcomes.
* There is notable hospital‐to‐hospital variation (even after adjusting for case mix).
* Night‐time crashes carry a higher risk.

### A few methodological caveats

1. **Month mapping bug**
   You’ve mapped days > 15 → month = 12 (December) instead of 1 (January). That likely confounds your “month” variable.
2. **Pandas SettingWithCopyWarning**
   Several chained assignments (e.g. creating `month`, dropping columns from a slice) can lead to silent bugs. Better to use `.loc` on the original DataFrame.
3. **Treatment encoding**
   Label-encoding high-cardinality categoricals (e.g. road names) can introduce spurious orderings. One-hot or target encoding would be safer for confounder control.
4. **Propensity-score matching issues**

   * Convergence warnings from `LogisticRegression` suggest scaling or more iterations are needed.
   * PSM alone can be unstable if common‐support is weak; you may want to check overlap, try inverse‐probability weighting, or doubly‐robust estimators.
5. **Unmeasured confounding**
   You’ve adjusted for many covariates, but speed, pre‐existing conditions, victim’s posture, crash dynamics, etc., aren’t in the data. Estimates will remain biased if those matter.

---

### Next steps to bolster confidence

* **Refutation tests** (DoWhy’s `model.refute_estimate`) to check sensitivity to unobserved confounding.
* **Alternative estimators** (IPW, Doubly Robust, Causal Forest) to see if ATEs are stable.
* **Better covariate engineering** (e.g. group roads by type, include weather, traffic volume if available).
* **Fix month variable** and re-run importances and seasonality checks.

With these tweaks, your causal claims will stand on even firmer ground. Overall, you’re on the right track — your results make sense, but a few coding and methodological fixes will make them bulletproof.
